# lib
 
This was a fun project that I abandoned some time ago. You can use this to learn php, there's a few things on OOP here. 

To install Clanclats\Hydrahon the database abstraction layer used in these scripts, run $composer require clancats/hydrahon in your project folder. Check out the documentation here https://github.com/ClanCats/Hydrahon. Of course, to process payment ypu need php sdk from paypal and they have documentation and samples.

Pretty much everything else you can learn online or message me at https://web.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100008068368106

Happy coding
