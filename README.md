# lib
 
This was a fun project that I abandoned some time ago. You can use this to learning php, a few things on OOP here. You need to install Clanclats\Hydrahon 

run composer require clanclats\hydrahon in your project folder 

pretty much everything else you can learn online or message me at https://web.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100008068368106

Happy coding
