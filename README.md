# lib
 
This was a fun project that I abandoned some time ago. You can use this to learning php, a few things on OOP here. You need to install Clanclats\Hydrahon 

run composer require clancats/hydrahon in your project folder. Check out the documentation here https://github.com/ClanCats/Hydrahon. Of course, for payment ypu need php sdk from paypal and they have documentation and samples.

pretty much everything else you can learn online or message me at https://web.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100008068368106

Happy coding
